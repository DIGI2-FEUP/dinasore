**D**ynamic **IN**telligent **A**rchitecture for **S**oftware and M**O**dular **RE**configuration - **DINASORE** - is a distributed platform that runs at the fog computing level, enabling the pre-processing of data using algorithms, that are encapsulated inside modules, i.e. Function Blocks (FBs).

The principal advantage of this platform is the redistribution of the running modules across a **Cyber-Physical System** (CPS). So the user can develop their own code, in Python, and then upload it to the different DINASORE nodes in the CPS. To draw the system it's used the **4DIAC-IDE** which is according the **IEC61499** standards. This version is targeted to the **Industry4.0** applications, for that, it also uses the **OPC-UA** protocol to allow communication with the other industrial components.
