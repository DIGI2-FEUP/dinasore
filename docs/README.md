**D**ynamic **IN**telligent **A**rchitecture for **S**oftware and M**O**dular **RE**configuration - **DINASORE** - is a distributed platform that runs at the
fog computing level, enabling the pre-processing of data using algorithms, that are encapsulated inside modules (function blocks).

The principal advantage of this platform is the redistribution of the running modules across a distributed fog network. 
So the user can develop their own code, in Python, and them upload it to the different DINASORE nodes in the network.
To draw the system it's used the 4DIAC-IDE witch is according the IEC61499 standards. 

This version is targeted to the Industry4.0 applications, for that it was also used the UPC-UA protocol to allow the communication with the other industrial components.
