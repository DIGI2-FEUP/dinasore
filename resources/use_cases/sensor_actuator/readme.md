## Sensor and Actuator Use Case

This is an example of two different sensors - Temperature and Voltage - that can control a set of LEDs to show the state of the system. If temperature is above a max value, LED 1 turns on, and if is below min value, LED 2 turns on. Additionally, if Voltage is above a certain max value, the LED3 turns on.
